                    <p>Hey! My name's Justin, and I'm a 16 year old incoming first year at UNSW studying Advanced Maths and Computer Science. </p>
                    <p>I actually wasn't always all that interested in programming: I'd always been incredibly bogged down by all the 'syntactic sugar' as I now call it.
                    I was pretty confident that I was going to study maths (despite me facing similar issues with it in my junior years haha) and I knew I wanted a double degree, but I wasn't too sure what to choose. </p>
                    <p>It wasn't until a good friend reccomended computer science that I decided to give it a go, starting Harvard's CS50 course online. </p>
                    <p>I was pleasently shocked by the problem solving it presented because I've always loved the satisfaction I get when I finally finish a maths problem. To be honest, I'm now looking forward to the CS component of my degree
                    more than the maths bit. </p>
                    <p>I'm super stoked to be even considered for the trainee program, and am really looking forward to gaining experience in frontend development and more experience programming generally as I am still quite new - I actually skipped three weeks
                    to the web development section of the course to develop this website but I'll be doubling back to have a crack at Python and SQL :). </p>
                    Feel free to fly to the CBD and Iraq to learn more about me! Again, super excited to gain some experience in React and especially web development.

                        <p>A bit more about me personally over here :).</p>
                        <p>A lot of people have hobbies but what I spend a lot of my time doing is learning. I really love learning new, interestingstuff from anywhere I can find it, but other than that I've been playing League of Legends for what feels like my whole life (and have roped most of these lovely people you see on the left into it).</p>
                        <p>That's my main hobby I suppose then - my family and friends. I am so so blessed to be surrounded by these people and spend most of my downtime with them. Super excited to make some new friends at university too!</p>
                        <p>Other than that, I try to make it a point to cycle as much as I can so I'm not such a couch potato. I like walking to places that I should really be driving to because it gives me time to think about things. I'm also a huge music fan - just the typical pop and R&B (fond of SZA's LANA right now).</p>
                        <p>Head to (roughly) where UNSW is to have a bit more info about my plans for the future!</p>
