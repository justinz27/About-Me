            <p>Now that you know who I am, I think that it's a good idea for you to see the person that I'd like to be.</p>
            <p>As I've mentioned, I'm doing Math/CS at UNSW and I've always wanted to go here (the only Open Day I ever want to was UNSW's). I'm not really sure exactly what I'll be doing in the future because I can do a lot with my program. Currently, I'm looking at either a postgrad degree if I like my honours component, or going into software development if I enjoy the CS bit. Looking into other roles like data analysis, quantitative finance and consulting are also on my radar - for now I'm just focusing on involving myself with people of similar mind and with similar goals.</p>
            <p>I really want to get a social experience out of university as well as WAMmaxing. I'm looking to apply for subcom in a few societies and also excited to see what programs like
            the TSP have in store for me in terms of getting better at uni.</p>
            <p>Speaking of other societies, I'm also part of MathSoc, CSEsoc and AUNSW (You'll learn more about that last one when you visit hte Middle East on this website).</p>
            <p>Head there for more info about my culture and background!</p>
